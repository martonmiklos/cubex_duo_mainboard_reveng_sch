# 3D systems CubeX DUO reverse engineered schematic
Reverse engineered schematics for the 3D system's CubeX DUO 3D printer mainboard.

Drawn in Autodesk EAGLE 9.x

Only the stepper drivers for the main axes and the LCD connector have been reverse engineered yet. 

Our goal was to create a simple step-dir driver from the board.
